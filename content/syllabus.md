## Course Description

This course is an introduction to audio forensics, a branch of forensic science. Audio forensics is the application of the science of digital audio to legal matters. This niche field of forensics has grown exponentially in recent years due to the near ubiquity of devices capable of producing audio forensic evidence, such as smartphones and surveillance cameras. Some recordings captured every day will inevitably be considered valid evidence in an investigation.

## Prerequisites

- **Course Prerequisites:** None
- **Technology Skills:** Basic audio editing knowledge

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Identify and accurately use core terminology, concepts, and historical precedents in forensic audio analysis, including authenticity principles, chain of custody, and landmark case studies.
2. Explain how physical acoustics, psychoacoustics, and digital audio systems influence the capture, perception, and interpretation of forensic sound evidence.
3. Apply standard forensic audio tools and methods to examine recordings for authenticity, integrity, and evidentiary relevance.
4. Analyze and interpret audio evidence by integrating signal analysis, environmental acoustics, and probabilistic reasoning to assess competing hypotheses.
5. Produce professionally structured forensic audio reports and oral explanations that meet scientific, technical, and legal standards for expert testimony.

## Course Materials

**Required Textbook:** Digital Audio Forensics Fundamentals (Available as an eBook in the DSU Library)

**Optional Materials:** Principles of Forensic Audio Analysis by Robert C. Maher

## Course Delivery

This is a Discussion/Recitation course. Topics are explored through short lectures, class discussion, instructor guided activities, individual student projects, and collaborative work. Students must come prepared to discuss the assigned material, which could be a reading, podcast, or YouTube video.
