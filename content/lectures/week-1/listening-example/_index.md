## Overview

This exercise introduces audio forensics by treating sound as primary evidence. You will practice disciplined listening, documentation, and hypothesis formation without relying on visual context or assumptions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

* Practice forensic listening rather than casual or narrative listening
* Identify audible details that may function as investigative leads
* Distinguish observation from interpretation
* Assess uncertainty and evidentiary limits in audio material

## Materials

* The audio recording linked above
* Notebook or digital document for notes

## Instructions

### Phase 1: First Listening — Raw Observation

Listen to the audio clip once.

**Rules:**

* Do not rewind or pause
* Do not discuss with others
* Do not interpret meaning or intent

**Task:**

Write down only what you can directly hear. Use brief, factual statements.

**Examples:**

* Number of voices
* Languages or dialects (if identifiable)
* Background sounds
* Mechanical or environmental noises
* Silence, overlap, interruptions

**Avoid:**

* Guessing identities
* Naming locations unless spoken
* Assigning motives or emotions

### Phase 2: Second Listening — Structured Notes

Listen to the audio clip a second time.

Organize your notes under the following headings:

**1. Human Voices**
   * Number of speakers
   * Turn-taking or dominance
   * Vocal qualities (pitch, pace, clarity)

**2. Environmental Sounds**
   * Indoor or outdoor indicators
   * Traffic, animals, machinery, weather
   * Distance or spatial cues

**3. Temporal Indicators**
   * Time-of-day clues
   * Rhythmic or scheduled sounds

**4. Technical Characteristics**
   * Noise floor
   * Compression or distortion
   * Recording quality or device clues

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Formation

Based on your observations, write three possible hypotheses about the context of the recording.

**For each hypothesis:**

* Clearly state the hypothesis
* List at least two audible observations that support it
* Assign a confidence level (low / medium / high)
* Describe what additional evidence would be needed to verify it

### Phase 4: Small-Group Comparison

Form a group of 3–4 students.

**As a group:**

* Compare observations
* Identify at least one sound noticed by only one group member
* Discuss why certain sounds stood out to different listeners

**Consider:**

* How personal experience shapes listening
* Which sounds felt "important," and why

### Phase 5: Reflection

Individually, respond in 3–5 sentences:

> At what point does interpretation become speculation, and how should a forensic analyst document that boundary?
