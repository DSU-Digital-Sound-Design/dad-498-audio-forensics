# Historical Case Studies in Forensic Audio

{{% note %}}
* Today is a tour through landmark cases and investigations that shaped audio forensics as a discipline.
* As we go, listen for two recurring threads: what courts needed in order to trust recordings, and how analytical methods evolved from auditory judgment to measurable, technology-driven approaches.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Why Case Studies Matter

- They set admissibility expectations
- They reveal failure modes (bias, hoaxes, bad handling)
- They drive technical innovation
- They show how conclusions can change over time

{{% note %}}
* Case studies are not just history; they function like stress tests for the field.
* They show what judges and juries expect, what investigators do under pressure, and where methods can fail.
* They also show how new tools and protocols emerge in response to real problems.
* Audio work is rarely “just audio”—it is tied to documentation, preservation, and clear reasoning about uncertainty.

## Roadmap

1. Foundational case law and legal precedents  
2. Landmark political and criminal investigations  
3. Hoaxes and high-profile criminal cases  
4. Aviation accident investigations  
5. Cross-cutting lessons for practice

{{% note %}}
* We’ll organize today around four clusters.
* First: legal foundations—what courts demanded before they would even listen.
* Second: political and criminal investigations where audio analysis played a central role.
* Third: hoaxes and headline cases that show how easily audio can mislead.
* Fourth: aviation, where CVRs act like technical sensors as much as recordings of human conversation.
* We’ll end by extracting practical lessons you can apply to any new recording.

# I. Foundational Case Law & Precedents

How courts learned to trust recordings

---

## United States v. McKeever (1958)

Established the **Seven Tenets of Audio Authenticity**  
Core question: **Does this recording have sufficient integrity for court?**

{{% note %}}
* McKeever is one of the earliest and most influential reference points for audio admissibility in U.S. federal court.
* Instead of arguing about every new tape from scratch, the case crystallized a checklist-style foundation for admitting recordings.
* The focus is not “sound quality”; it’s integrity and handling—can the court treat this as a reliable record of what happened?
{{%/note%}}

---

## McKeever: Case Context

- Late 1950s US federal court case  
- Defendants: **Thomas McKeever** and **Lawrence Morrison**  
- Indicted under federal **anti-racketeering** laws for extortion/conspiracy  
- Both were agents for a local branch of the **International Longshoremen’s Association**  
- Alleged threats toward **James J. Ball & Sons** (a company holding union contracts)

{{% note %}}
* Here’s the context that often gets skipped when McKeever is reduced to “the seven tenets.”
* The government indicted Thomas McKeever and Lawrence Morrison under federal anti-racketeering laws.
* The allegation was extortion: threats directed at James J. Ball & Sons, a company holding contracts connected to the Longshoremen’s union.
* This is exactly the kind of case where credibility and precise wording matter, and both sides have incentives to frame what was said and what was meant.
{{%/note%}}

---

## McKeever: Where the Audio Came From

- Not government surveillance  
- After indictments, **McKeever arranged meetings** with Ball Company representatives  
- He **secretly tape-recorded** those conversations  
- Defense sought to use the recordings to **impeach** prosecution witness **George Ball**

{{% note %}}
* This case is instructive because the recordings were not produced by the state.
* After the indictments, McKeever arranged meetings and secretly had conversations tape-recorded.
* The defense wanted to use the tapes to impeach a prosecution witness, George Ball, by showing inconsistency with prior recorded statements.
* That sets up the key evidentiary question: even if the tape sounds plausible, what foundation is required before a jury can rely on it?
{{%/note%}}

---

## McKeever: How the Court Handled the Tape

- During cross-examination, witness said he **didn’t remember** the key conversation  
- Judge allowed the witness to listen **on headphones** (jury present but **not hearing**)  
- The tape was used to **refresh memory**, not entered for jury review  
- After listening, the witness said he **now recalled** and reaffirmed prior testimony

{{% note %}}
* This is a good example of a court balancing usefulness with reliability.
* On cross-examination, George Ball said he didn’t remember the key conversation.
* The judge allowed the witness to listen on headphones with the jury present but not hearing the tape.
* That means the tape was used to refresh recollection, not admitted as evidence for the jury.
* After listening, the witness said he now remembered and reaffirmed his prior testimony.
* The judge wasn’t “anti-audio”—the court was cautious about what the jury could rely on.
{{%/note%}}

---

## McKeever: Why the Tenets Were Articulated

- Defense asked to play the tape for the jury to show inconsistency  
- Prosecution objected: no foundation for **accuracy/authenticity**  
- Court refused admission and summarized the **required foundation** (the Seven Tenets)

{{% note %}}
* After the witness listened, the defense argued his testimony conflicted with the recorded conversation and asked to play the tape for the jury.
* The prosecution objected: no sufficient foundation for accuracy or authenticity, and no proof the tape captured the alleged conversation.
* The judge refused to admit the tape for the jury and summarized what must be shown before sound recordings are admitted.
* That summary becomes the Seven Tenets of Audio Authenticity.
{{%/note%}}

---

## The Seven Tenets (McKeever)

1. Device was capable of recording  
2. Operator was competent  
3. Recording is correct  
4. No changes, additions, or deletions  
5. Properly preserved (chain of custody)  
6. Speakers identified  
7. Conversation was voluntary / lawful

{{% note %}}
* Read these as the backbone of forensic thinking about recordings.
* Notice how technical and procedural requirements are mixed.
* “Device capable” and “operator competent” ask whether the capture process could plausibly produce an accurate record.
* “Recording is correct” and “no changes” push toward validation that content is continuous and unaltered.
* “Properly preserved” is chain of custody—who had it, when, and what they did.
* “Speakers identified” anticipates speaker comparison work.
* “Voluntary” reminds us admissibility also depends on how the recording was obtained, not just what it contains.
{{%/note%}}

---

## McKeever’s Forward-Looking Point

“Current advances in the technology of electronics and sound recordings make inevitable their increased use… Courts should deal with this class of evidence… Safeguards against fraud… are provided by judicial insistence that a proper foundation… be laid.”

{{% note %}}
* This is one of the most striking parts of the opinion.
* The court predicts the future: recordings will become more common and more probative.
* The response is not to ban them, but to insist on safeguards via a proper foundation.
* In modern terms: we expect more audio evidence, and we protect the process with traceable provenance, integrity checks, and transparent methods.

## McMillan Case (1974): Recorded Drug-Trafficking Calls

- 1974 federal narcotics conviction → appeal focused on audio evidence  
- Informant: **Beverly Johnson** acted as a go-between  
- Agents monitored Johnson using a **telephone recording device**  
- Multiple calls with suspect **Harold McMillan** involved heroin purchase arrangements  
- Captured **various conversations** tied to the trafficking operation

{{% note %}}
* McMillan follows McKeever by shifting from defense-created recordings to an investigative recording context.
* A 1974 federal narcotics conviction led to an appeal focused on the recordings used at trial.
* Informant Beverly Johnson acted as a go-between; agents recorded conversations on her telephone.
* Several calls with Harold McMillan involved arrangements for purchasing heroin.
* The appellate question becomes: what foundation must be laid before these recordings can be treated as reliable evidence?
{{%/note%}}

---

## McMillan: Recordings + Transcripts at Trial

- Judge allowed prosecutor to play **excerpts** of the calls for the jury  
- Judge allowed an agent to read a **written transcript** of the recordings  
- Defense objected: foundation for **authenticity** and **legal admissibility** not established

{{% note %}}
* At trial, the judge allowed the prosecutor to play excerpts of the recorded conversations for the jury.
* The judge also allowed an agent to read a written transcript of the recordings.
* That pairing is powerful because the transcript can guide—or override—what jurors think they hear in imperfect audio.
* The defense objected: authenticity and legal foundation had not been established.
* On appeal, the court had to address questions like: is the recording what it claims to be, and how do we connect voices on the tape to the people in the case?
{{%/note%}}

---

## McMillan: What the Appeal Reinforced

- Reaffirmed the core **tenets of admissibility** for recorded evidence  
- Emphasized establishing **authenticity** (accurate, unaltered)  
- Addressed **talker identification** as part of the required foundation

{{% note %}}
* McMillan matters because, like McKeever, the appeal reinforces the basic tenets of admissibility—especially authenticity.
* It also addresses specific questions about establishing talker identification.
* It’s not enough to say “we have a tape” and “an agent says this is the defendant.”
* The court expects a foundation supporting accuracy and authenticity, showing proper handling, and providing a defensible basis for identifying speakers.
* Conceptually, it’s McKeever applied to recorded telephone conversations introduced alongside transcripts in front of a jury.
{{%/note%}}

## UK Development and PACE (1984)

- First documented UK forensic speaker comparison: **1965**
- Casework volume rose after **Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984**
- PACE mandated audio recording of police interviews

{{% note %}}
* In the UK, growth in forensic speaker comparison is closely tied to policy.
* Early work existed—speaker comparison is documented as far back as 1965.
* The field accelerates when PACE (1984) mandates audio recording of police interviews.
* That creates a steady pipeline of “known” voice samples for comparison.
* It also forces methods to scale and become more standardized as casework volume increases.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Methodology Split: Admissibility in the UK

**R v. Robb (1991)** (England & Wales): auditory-only analysis admissible  
**R v. O’Doherty (2002)** (Northern Ireland): **acoustic analysis required**

{{% note %}}
* These cases illustrate a methodological tension: is trained listening sufficient, or must the opinion be supported by measurable acoustic evidence?
* In Robb, the court accepted auditory-only analysis.
* In O’Doherty, the court required acoustic analysis (often framed as formant or other instrumental measures).
* The deeper lesson: the legal system can dictate what “counts” as a method, and expectations may differ across jurisdictions.
{{%/note%}}

## Talker Identification and “Voiceprints”

- “Voiceprint” appears in Bell Labs publications as early as **1944**
- 1962: Bell Labs’ **Lawrence Kersta** publishes “Voiceprint Identification” (Nature)
- Claim: vocal-tract anatomy yields uniquely identifying **speech spectrograms**
- Appealing analogy: “audio fingerprint” for unknown-to-known comparisons

{{% note %}}
* Now let’s zoom in on a specific admissibility problem: identifying who is speaking.
* “Voiceprint” shows up early—Bell Labs publications used it as far back as 1944.
* The idea becomes popular after Lawrence Kersta’s 1962 Nature paper, “Voiceprint Identification.”
* Kersta’s claim: vocal-tract anatomy should produce spectrogram patterns unique to an individual.
* If that were strongly true, you could compare an unknown voice to a library of known voices like fingerprints.
* It’s an intuitive story—and exactly why the field had to test it carefully.
{{%/note%}}

---

## The Aural–Spectrographic Method (1960s–1970s)

Workflow:
- Unknown speech from wiretap / answering machine / surveillance
- “Known” speech recorded from a suspect (often using a matching script)
- Examiner uses **critical listening + spectrogram comparison**
- Output is an opinion about likelihood of same talker

{{% note %}}
* In practice, “voiceprints” became associated with an aural–spectrographic method.
* Start with unknown speech, often telephone quality, from wiretaps, answering machines, or surveillance.
* Collect a known sample from a suspect, often using a script that matches the unknown content.
* The examiner combines careful listening with visual comparison of spectrograms.
* The result is not a magic match—it’s an expert opinion about how likely the samples come from the same talker.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Voiceprint Opinions (Classic Five-Point Scale)

1. **Positive identification**
2. **Probable identification**
3. **No decision**
4. **Probable elimination**
5. **Positive elimination**

{{% note %}}
* Practitioners often reported conclusions using a five-point scale from positive identification to positive elimination.
* This acknowledges uncertainty: sometimes the data doesn’t support a confident call.
* It also shows how the method was used in court-like decision contexts long before modern statistical speaker recognition.
* Ask: what evidence supports moving from “no decision” to “probable,” and from “probable” to “positive”?
* That question sits at the heart of reliability and admissibility debates.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Reliability Questions and the NAS Warning (1970s)

- Studies challenged “spectrograms are unique and time-invariant”
- Raised risks of **false identification** and **false elimination**
- 1976: FBI asked National Academy of Sciences/NRC to review reliability
- 1979 panel: use in testimony only with **clear explanation of limitations**

{{% note %}}
* Despite promising early results, significant challenges emerged.
* Researchers questioned the assumptions that speech is spectrographically unique and stable over time.
* That raises risks of false identification and false elimination.
* In 1976, the FBI asked the NAS/NRC to review the scientific basis and reliability because courts were already seeing this evidence.
* The panel’s conclusion was cautious: if used in testimony, limitations must be clearly and thoroughly explained to the judge or jury.
* This is an early articulation of a best practice we still follow: strong claims require strong validation, and courtroom communication must not oversell the method.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Takeaway: Law Shapes Method

- Courts want **process** as much as results  
- Documentation + transparency are not optional  
- Methods trend toward **measurable, reproducible evidence**

{{% note %}}
* If you take only one thing from this section, take this: law doesn’t just evaluate forensic audio—it actively shapes it.
* The strongest analyses are explainable step-by-step, defensible with documentation, and reproducible or validated with independent checks.
* Over time, that pressure nudges the field away from purely perceptual claims and toward instrument-assisted and statistically framed approaches.

# II. Landmark Political & Criminal Investigations

When audio evidence changed national narratives

---

## The Watergate Tapes (1974)

Origin: June 1972 Watergate break-in → widening investigation  
Key issue: **18½-minute gap** on a Nixon–Haldeman tape (June 20, 1972)  
Technique: **magnetic development** to visualize **Bitter Patterns**

{{% note %}}
* Watergate is a classic example of analog authenticity work under enormous public pressure.
* It starts with the June 1972 break-in, which quickly expands into allegations of a broader cover-up.
* The audio-forensics milestone comes when investigators learn the White House had been recording conversations and focus on a June 20, 1972 Nixon–Haldeman tape.
* The technical question is simple: what happened during the 18½-minute gap?
* Answering it requires treating the tape as physical evidence.
* Magnetic development reveals Bitter Patterns—traces that indicate erase/record activity.
* This wasn’t about “enhancing” missing audio; it was about reconstructing what was done to the tape and whether the gap reflects one event or multiple actions.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Watergate: The Break-In That Started It (June 17, 1972)

- Night guard **Frank Wills** noticed tape on a door latch  
- Tape was removed and later found **reapplied**  
- Police found **five burglars** in Democratic National Committee offices  
- Set off the chain of events leading to Senate hearings and the tapes

{{% note %}}
* This “how it started” detail matters because it shows how a minor observation can trigger a national investigation.
* Frank Wills noticed duct tape on a door latch, removed it, and assumed it was left from construction.
* Later he found it had been reapplied, which looked deliberate, and he called police.
* Police discovered five burglars inside the DNC offices.
* Nobody predicted it would lead to a presidential resignation, but it starts the timeline that makes later recordings so probative.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Watergate: Discovery of the White House Tapes (1973)

- Senate Select Committee formed: **Feb 7, 1973**  
- Public hearings increased pressure through spring 1973  
- July 1973: aide **Alexander Butterfield** revealed a White House taping system  
- Nixon initially resisted releasing tapes; subpoenas followed late 1973

{{% note %}}
* By early 1973, evidence suggested the break-in was part of broader activity connected to the reelection campaign and possibly obstruction of justice.
* The Senate formed a special committee and held widely watched hearings.
* The turning point for audio evidence came in July 1973 when Alexander Butterfield disclosed an internal White House recording system.
* Nixon initially refused to release tapes under executive privilege; subpoenas followed for transcripts and specific recordings.
* This explains why the tapes are both legally contested and politically explosive.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Watergate: Where and How the Tapes Were Recorded

Installed during Nixon’s first term (conversations dating back to **1971**)  
Recording systems in:
- Oval Office and Cabinet Room (White House)
- President’s private office (Executive Office Building, EOB)
- Camp David

{{% note %}}
* Butterfield’s revelation wasn’t “there is one tape”—it was that there was an entire recording system installed at Nixon’s direction.
* It captured conversations across multiple locations: Oval Office, Cabinet Room, EOB private office, and Camp David.
* Only the president and a small group of aides knew the system existed.
* For forensic audio, this expands the problem from an isolated recording to a complex system, raising questions about equipment, operating conditions, custody, and how to interpret gaps or anomalies.

## Watergate: The 18½-Minute Gap and the Advisory Panel

- June 20, 1972 Nixon–Haldeman tape: segment of interest became **18½ minutes of buzzing**  
- Suspected deliberate erase/record-over to destroy incriminating content  
- Nov 1973: Judge **John J. Sirica** ordered forensic study  
- Six outside experts formed a technical panel to assess authenticity

{{% note %}}
* Investigators focused on a Nixon–Haldeman conversation recorded in the Executive Office Building on June 20, 1972, just three days after the break-in.
* They suspected it covered how to respond and whether to conceal involvement.
* The relevant portion wasn’t just quiet; it was replaced by about 18½ minutes of buzzing with no detectable conversation.
* That suggests either an accident or a deliberate attempt to erase or record over content.
* Chief Judge John Sirica ordered forensic examination, and outside experts were nominated to study the tape and recorded sounds.
* This becomes an early high-profile example of systematic authenticity assessment.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Watergate: Findings and Impact

- Forensics: multiple overlapping erasures detected  
- Erasures made using a **different recorder model** than the original  
- May 1974: panel reported erasures occurred **after** the original recording  
- July 24, 1974: Supreme Court ordered release of tapes → **“Smoking Gun”**  
- Aug 8, 1974: Nixon resigned amid impeachment threat

{{% note %}}
* The technical panel concluded the gap was not a single clean deletion.
* The tape showed multiple overlapping erasures, and those erasures appeared to come from a different recorder model than the one that made the original recording.
* The May 1974 report argued erasures occurred after the original session, shifting the interpretation from “accident” toward “intervention.”
* The legal timeline matters: on July 24, 1974, the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to produce relevant recordings.
* The “Smoking Gun” tape documented approval of a plan to have the CIA invoke national security concerns to block an FBI investigation—widely seen as obstruction of justice.
* Without political support, Nixon resigned on August 8, 1974.
* The forensic takeaway: authenticity work can become central to national-level accountability.

## JFK Assassination Re-evaluation (1978–1980)

Source: Dallas Police **dictabelt recording**  
Question: evidence of a second shooter?

{{% note %}}
* The JFK re-evaluation shows how early interpretations can harden into public belief—and how later technical review can overturn them.
* Investigators analyzed a dictabelt recording for impulses that might correspond to gunshots.
* Some early experts reported a high probability of a shot from the “grassy knoll,” implying a second shooter.
* The key point: the signal and context were complicated, leaving room for confident but fragile conclusions.
{{%/note%}}

---

## JFK: The Crosstalk Correction

1980 National Academy of Sciences review used **crosstalk analysis**  
Identified Sheriff Bill Decker: “**Hold everything secure**” on both channels  
Conclusion: the “shots” occurred ~**one minute after** the assassination

{{% note %}}
* The NAS review used crosstalk analysis—exploiting leakage between channels—to establish timing.
* They found Sheriff Bill Decker saying “Hold everything secure” on both radio channels.
* That provided a synchronization anchor to align the recordings.
* Once aligned, the purported impulses occurred roughly a minute after the assassination.
* This is a verification lesson: don’t just ask “does it sound like a gunshot”—ask “are we even at the right moment in time?”
{{%/note%}}

---

## Kent State Shooting Analysis (2010)

Source: digital copy of a 1970 student reel-to-reel tape  
Modern enhancement revealed: “**All right, prepare to fire!**”  
Gunshots followed ~**two seconds** later

{{% note %}}
* Kent State shows the value—and the controversy—of reanalyzing historical recordings with modern tools.
* Stuart Allen and Tom Owen worked from a digital copy of a student reel-to-reel tape recorded by Terry Strubbe.
* Using modern enhancement, they reported a command—“All right, prepare to fire!”—followed shortly by gunshots.
* Even if interpretations are debated, the case shows how noise reduction and time–frequency tools can clarify ambiguous material and reopen historical questions.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Kent State: Additional Findings

- Detected **four shots** consistent with a .38-caliber revolver  
- Occurred ~**70 seconds** before the main volley  
- Supported theories of an earlier altercation

{{% note %}}
* Beyond the command phrase, the analysis reported four shots well before the main volley, consistent with a .38-caliber revolver.
* The interpretation was that this supports theories of an earlier confrontation, potentially involving an FBI informant.
* Methodologically, separate what the signal processing reveals as candidate events from the narrative you attach to those events.
* In forensic reporting, keep observations and interpretations clearly distinguished.

# III. Hoaxes & High-Profile Cases

How audio misleads—and how analysts course-correct

---

## The “Wearside Jack” Hoax (1978–2005)

Context: hunt for the **Yorkshire Ripper**  
Hoaxer sent: cassette tape + three letters  
Key feature: distinctive **Wearside accent**

{{% note %}}
* Wearside Jack is a notorious example of how persuasive audio can be, especially when it seems to offer a concrete clue like an accent.
* John Samuel Humble sent police a tape and letters claiming responsibility for the Yorkshire Ripper murders.
* The voice had a distinctive Wearside accent, which made it compelling.
* Investigators chased that lead for a long time, showing how easily an audio cue can become a cognitive anchor.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Wearside Jack: Consequences and Resolution

- Investigation diverted to Sunderland for **18 months**
- Police discounted Peter Sutcliffe (Yorkshire accent mismatch)
- 2005: DNA from envelope gum matched national database → conviction

{{% note %}}
* The consequences were real: investigators were diverted to Sunderland for about 18 months.
* The accent mismatch contributed to discounting the eventual perpetrator, Peter Sutcliffe.
* The hoax was solved not by audio, but by DNA from envelope gum matched in the national database.
* The lesson is not “audio is useless,” but “audio cues can be highly biasing.”
* As analysts, we should present what the audio supports, quantify uncertainty, and avoid letting one salient feature dominate decision-making.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Trayvon Martin Case (2012)

Question: whose screams are heard on a 911 call?  
Expert: **Edward Primeau** concluded the voice was likely Martin’s

{{% note %}}
* The Trayvon Martin case highlights limits of speaker identification when evidence is weak.
* The material involves screams, emotional vocalizations, and a noisy telephone channel.
* Many features used for routine speaker comparison—stable vowels, consistent phonetic content, controlled conditions—aren’t available.
* An opinion may still be offered, but its strength depends on the material and on how clearly limitations and alternatives are communicated.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Corporate Fraud Case Study

Audio dismissed after:
- **metadata analysis** revealed timestamp inconsistencies
- **speaker verification** showed spliced segments from a different source

{{% note %}}
* This illustrates a modern pattern: recordings can be undermined by surrounding evidence, not just the sound itself.
* Metadata inconsistencies—implausible timestamps, mismatched encoding histories—raise integrity questions.
* Speaker verification can test whether segments are consistent with the same talker under similar conditions.
* If checks indicate splicing from another source, courts may treat the evidence as too compromised to use.
* This is why metadata, file history, and signal continuity are part of the evidence, not an afterthought.

# IV. Aviation Accident Investigations

Treating the cockpit as an acoustic sensor array

---

## Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVR): What They Capture

- Crew communications
- Alarms and warnings
- Engine whine and mechanical tones
- Airframe vibrations (clunks, rattles)

{{% note %}}
* In aviation, the CVR is not just a “microphone in the cockpit.”
* It’s a multi-channel sensor capturing speech, alarms, and the aircraft’s acoustic signature.
* Investigators listen to what was said and how crews reacted, but they also measure tones, rhythms, and transients that reflect mechanical behavior.
* CVR work is forensic interpretation grounded in physics and engineering, not just linguistics.
{{%/note%}}

---

## USAir Flight 427 (1994)

CVR analysis focused on:
- crew reactions during sudden emergency
- structure-borne vibrations captured by ceiling microphone  
Outcome: traced failure to **rudder power control unit defect**

{{% note %}}
* USAir 427 shows how non-speech audio can be central evidence.
* Analysts treated clunks and rattles—structure-borne vibrations—as clues, not “noise” to remove.
* Combined with other investigation, those signatures supported a rudder power control unit defect.
* Takeaway: the most probative events can be mechanical, brief, and easy to overlook without careful analysis.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Germanwings Flight 9525 (2015)

CVR revealed:
- copilot locked captain out of flight deck
- **steady breathing** indicated consciousness and intent throughout descent

{{% note %}}
* Germanwings 9525 is a stark example where interpretation extends beyond “what was said.”
* The CVR captured steady breathing that investigators interpreted as evidence the copilot was conscious during the descent.
* Combined with other sounds—like the captain being locked out—the audio supported a conclusion of intentional action.
* It also raises ethical questions: how to describe human states from audio, how cautious to be, and how to separate observable facts from inferences about intent.
{{%/note%}}

---

## Execuflight Flight 1526 (2015)

No Flight Data Recorder available  
Investigators used CVR loop to measure **turbine whine** frequencies  
Inferred throttle settings and turbine speed before stall/crash

{{% note %}}
* Execuflight 1526 demonstrates frequency analysis in a direct way.
* With no flight data recorder, investigators used the CVR as a proxy sensor.
* Jet engines produce tonal components like turbine whine that shift with rotational speed.
* Measuring those frequencies over time supports inferences about engine speed and approximate throttle behavior leading up to a stall or crash.
* This is a clean example of how basic DSP—spectral peaks and frequency tracking—translates into real forensic conclusions.
{{%/note%}}

## Cross-Cutting Evolution of Methods

**Analog era:** physical media inspection (e.g., Bitter Patterns)  
**Transition:** auditory-phonetic expertise + documentation standards  
**Digital era:** metadata, waveform continuity, DSP, statistical inference  
**Today:** deepfakes and synthetic speech detection pressures

{{% note %}}
* Stepping back, you can see an arc in methods.
* Early work often relied on the physics of the medium—what tape could reveal about erasures and re-recording.
* Over time, trained listening and phonetic expertise were formalized, while courts demanded measurable support and transparent reasoning.
* In the digital era, authenticity often becomes data consistency plus signal continuity, paired with DSP-driven measurements.
* Today, synthetic speech and deepfakes add pressure to verify not only edits, but whether a voice could be artificially generated.
{{%/note%}}

## Practical Checklist for Any New Recording

1. Preserve originals; document every transfer  
2. Assess integrity (metadata + signal continuity)  
3. Define the question (authenticity, enhancement, interpretation)  
4. Use validated methods; report uncertainty  
5. Keep work reproducible (settings, tools, logs)

{{% note %}}
* If someone hands you a recording tomorrow, your first job is not enhancement—it’s preservation and documentation.
* Keep the original, log how you received it, and label working copies clearly.
* Check integrity using both metadata and signal behavior.
* Be explicit about the question: authenticity, enhancement, or interpretation?
* Use defensible, validated methods when possible.
* Make work reproducible by recording tool versions, settings, and steps so another analyst could replicate the result.
{{%/note%}}

## Discussion Questions

- Which case most clearly shows **method driving admissibility**?  
- Where do you see **bias** shaping interpretation?  
- What is one “verification cross-check” you would add in each scenario?

{{% note %}}
* To close, pick one case and answer three questions.
* First: how did method determine what the court or investigative body would accept as evidence?
* Second: where could bias enter—accent, expectations, political pressure, or the desire for a clean narrative?
* Third: what independent cross-check would you add to protect yourself from being misled?
* Build the habit of asking: “What would have to be true for my conclusion to be wrong, and how can I test that?”
